Custom controls are an important part of developing apps for iOS, allowing you to develop engaging user experiences, while achieving great code separability and reuse. When the Apple-provided controls don’t quite give you what you want, then creating your own custom controls is a great option, and it isn’t nearly as scary as it first sounds! Learn how to create custom controls for iOS by taking a look at three different approaches covered in this series. First you’ll discover how you can compose UIKit components to build your own control, before moving on to using Core Animation to create controls with more visual complexity. Finally you’ll see how you can use Core Graphics to “draw” the appearance of controls yourself. Along the way you’ll learn how to handle user interaction, interface builder integration and dynamic frameworks.
